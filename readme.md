# End-to-End Multi-client Service Oriented Applications(SOA)

Learned building Service Oriented Application (SOA), a complete application from beginning to end, covering every layer in the architecture. Everything from the database and the data access layer, through the business tiers, all the way into the service layer, all the entities on the business side of the wire, into the client side of the wire, all of the proxy layers. The course demonstrate not only how to use the technology, but also patterns of implementation and connectivity that let you see how all the layers talk to each other. All of the layers in the application follow solid principles which allow for really good code manageability, and extensibility, and of course, testability. It also covers unit test, dependency injection usage from the data layer, all the way up to the service layer. The course uses a multitude of technologies in the middle-tier and was consumed by different UI clients on the web and the desktop.
